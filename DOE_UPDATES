            testimonials if we have any testimonials
        2. Upcoming Events

            	Date, Event, Location, > 
            - See https://s3.amazonaws.com/leftbrain-docs/uploads%2F1459113871093-1.jpg for schedule
            - See https://s3.amazonaws.com/leftbrain-docs/uploads%2F1458605856579-8.jpg for event info
	- Better Gallery, Just use a grid, you don't need to filter by event type
    	- Maybe on picture popup have small info thing that says the event the pic belongs to
	- Testimonials page
    	- http://www.pixeels.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/single_normal2.jpg
